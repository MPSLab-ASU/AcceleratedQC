WORKLOG: Hadamard Kernel Integration for AMD Catalyst Runtime
============================================================

Date: [Jul 26, 2024]
Project: AMD Catalyst Runtime - Hadamard Kernel Integration
Location: AMD/catalyst/runtime/lib/backend/custom_device/

OVERVIEW:
---------
This worklog documents the complete process of integrating the Hadamard kernel from the Kernels/
directory into the Catalyst runtime custom device backend, enabling real quantum computing
operations through PennyLane with FPGA acceleration support.

INITIAL STATE:
--------------
- Custom device backend was working with dummy output: `(1+0j)`
- Hadamard kernel available in `Kernels/src/` directory
- Need to connect kernel to PennyLane interface for real quantum operations

OBJECTIVE:
----------
Replace dummy output with real Hadamard transformations that produce correct quantum
superposition states, enabling FPGA-accelerated quantum computing through PennyLane.

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
=======================

PHASE 1: Kernel Integration Architecture
======================================

Approach:
---------
Created a multi-layer architecture to connect PennyLane to FPGA hardware:
1. Python Layer: PennyLane device interface
2. C++ Layer: Custom device with FPGA/CPU switching
3. Kernel Layer: FPGA kernel wrapper
4. Hardware Layer: XRT-based FPGA communication

Implementation:
---------------
1. Modified CustomDevice.hpp to add kernel interface declarations
2. Updated CustomDevice.cpp to integrate FPGA kernel calls
3. Created HadamardKernelWrapper.cpp for kernel interface
4. Updated CMakeLists.txt to include kernel sources and XRT dependencies

PHASE 2: C++ Interface Development
==================================

ISSUE #1: C++ Function Export for Python
========================================

Problem:
--------
Python ctypes couldn't access C++ functions due to name mangling:
```
undefined symbol: hadamard_kernel_execute
```

Root Cause:
-----------
C++ functions are exported with name mangling, making them inaccessible to Python ctypes.

Investigation:
--------------
1. Checked available symbols: `nm -D librtd_custom_device.so | grep hadamard`
2. Found mangled symbol: `_ZN8Catalyst7Runtime7Devices23hadamard_kernel_execute...`

Solution:
---------
Created C-style wrapper function in HadamardKernelWrapper.cpp:
```cpp
extern "C" {
    int hadamard_kernel_execute_c(const char* xclbin_path,
                                  const double* input_real, const double* input_imag,
                                  double* output_real, double* output_imag,
                                  int target, int num_qubits, int state_size) {
        // Convert C arrays to C++ vectors and call kernel
    }
}
```

Result:
-------
C-style function `hadamard_kernel_execute_c` is now accessible from Python ctypes.

PHASE 3: Python Interface Enhancement
====================================

ISSUE #2: Dummy Output Replacement
==================================

Problem:
--------
Python interface was returning dummy state: `(1+0j)` instead of real Hadamard transformations.

Root Cause:
-----------
The execute() method was returning hardcoded dummy values instead of calling the C++ kernel.

Solution:
---------
Completely rewrote the execute() method in circuit.py:
1. Added C++ library loading with ctypes
2. Implemented real Hadamard transformation logic
3. Added proper state vector initialization and manipulation
4. Created step-by-step transformation display

Implementation Details:
----------------------
```python
def _load_cpp_library(self):
    # Load shared library and set up function signatures
    
def _apply_hadamard_cpp(self, state, target_qubit, num_qubits):
    # Convert Python state to C arrays and call kernel
    
def execute(self, circuits, execution_config=None):
    # Initialize state to |0...0⟩ and apply Hadamard transformations
```

PHASE 4: Build System Integration
=================================

ISSUE #3: Kernel Source Path Configuration
=========================================

Problem:
--------
CMake couldn't find kernel source files:
```
Cannot find source file: ../../../../Kernels/src/hadamard_host_xrt.cpp
```

Root Cause:
-----------
Relative path was incorrect from custom_device directory to kernel sources.

Solution:
---------
Updated CMakeLists.txt with conditional compilation:
```cmake
set(KERNEL_SOURCE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../../Kernels/src/hadamard_host_xrt.cpp)
if(EXISTS ${KERNEL_SOURCE})
    set(KERNEL_SOURCES ${KERNEL_SOURCE})
    add_definitions(-DHAS_HADAMARD_KERNEL)
else()
    set(KERNEL_SOURCES "")
    message(WARNING "FPGA functionality will be disabled")
endif()
```

Result:
-------
Build system now works with or without kernel sources, providing graceful fallback.

PHASE 5: Error Handling and Fallback
====================================

ISSUE #4: FPGA Kernel Unavailability
====================================

Problem:
--------
FPGA kernel not available (no XRT environment, no bitstream), but system should still work.

Root Cause:
-----------
No fallback mechanism when FPGA kernel is unavailable.

Solution:
---------
Implemented comprehensive fallback system:
1. Added `useFPGAKernel()` method to detect FPGA availability
2. Created `applyHadamardCPU()` for CPU implementation
3. Added automatic detection of missing bitstream files
4. Implemented graceful degradation with informative messages

Implementation:
---------------
```cpp
void CustomDevice::applyHadamard(QubitIdType wire) {
    if (useFPGAKernel()) {
        // Use FPGA kernel
        int status = hadamard_kernel_execute(xclbin_path_, state_, output_state, wire, num_qubits_);
        if (status != 0) {
            // Fall back to CPU implementation
            applyHadamardCPU(wire);
        }
    } else {
        // Use CPU implementation
        applyHadamardCPU(wire);
    }
}
```

PHASE 6: Testing and Validation
===============================

ISSUE #5: Output Verification
=============================

Problem:
--------
Need to verify that the kernel produces correct quantum mechanical output.

Solution:
---------
Created comprehensive test suite (test_hadamard_output.py):
1. Single qubit Hadamard transformation
2. Two qubit Hadamard transformation  
3. Three qubit Hadamard transformation
4. Mathematical property verification
5. Quantum superposition effects demonstration

Test Results:
-------------
✅ Single Qubit: |0⟩ → |+⟩ = [0.70710678+0j, 0.70710678+0j]
✅ Two Qubit: |00⟩ → |++⟩ = [0.5+0j, 0.5+0j, 0.5+0j, 0.5+0j]
✅ Three Qubit: |000⟩ → |+++⟩ = [0.35355339+0j, ..., 0.35355339+0j]
✅ Mathematical Accuracy: All results match theoretical expectations with precision 1e-6
